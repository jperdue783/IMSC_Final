What to Do

First download Image-Speech-Text-Processing.PY.tar.

Untar it to see the file pdf im2text and some example codes in the direc-

tory example-code.

1. Complete pdfim2text appropriately.

* You may find clues from example-code/pdf2txt.py

2. Implement speech2text from the scratch.

* You may get hints from speech_mic2wave.py and image2text.py

in the directory example-code.

Try to put all functions into a single file for each command, which en-

hances portability of the commands.

Report

* Work in a directory, of which the name begins with your last name.

* Use the three-page project document as an example for pdf im2text.

* zip or tar your work directory and submit via email.

* Write a report to explain what you have done, including images and

wave files; upload it to Canvas.

PDF-Image to Texts

As a part of the project,

you will develop a Python program

Happy Fish

that can extract texts from

PDF files and images:

and generally,

from PDF files including images.

An example PDF is

the one you are reading now.

(This portion is an image, by text2image.py.)
