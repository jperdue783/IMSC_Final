P.2. Text Extraction and Processing for Images,

PDF's, and Speech Data

In text extraction applications, the core is the Optical Character

Recognition (OCR) technology.

* Its primary function is to extract texts from images.

* Using advanced Al algorithms and machine learning, the OCR

can identify and convert image texts into audio files, for easy lis-

tening.

There are some powerful text extraction software (having accuracy of 98+%),

which are not freely/conveniently available. Thus we will implement two

text extraction algorithms, one for image data and the other for speech data.

Project Objectives: The project will develop two separate Python pro-

grams: pdf im2text and speech2text.

1. PDF-Image to Text (pdfim2text)

* Input: an image or a pdf file

— A PDF may include images.

— A PDF may be generated by scanning, in which each page is

an image.

* Core Task: Extract all texts; play texts from an image

2. Speech to Text+Speech (speech2text)

* Input: speech from microphone or a wave file

* Core Task: Extract texts; play the extracted texts.
